# MyParser

This project implements a lexer and parser for a simple programming language using JFlex and BYacc/J. The lexer tokenizes the input code into meaningful symbols, while the parser processes these tokens to build a syntax tree and validate the structure of the code. This foundation can be utilized in various applications, including early detection and localization systems in agriculture, specifically targeting the red palm weevil pest.

## Technologies Used

- **Lexer**: JFlex
- **Parser**: BYacc/J
- **Programming Language**: Java

## Features

- Lexical analysis with JFlex to identify tokens such as keywords, operators, identifiers, and literals.
- Syntax analysis with BYacc/J to validate the structure of the code and build a parse tree.
- Support for basic operations, including arithmetic and logical expressions.
- Error handling for unrecognized characters and syntax errors.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- JFlex
- BYacc/J
